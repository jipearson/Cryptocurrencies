## Analysis Overview
Create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. The cryptocurrency data we are working with needs to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for we will use unsupervised learning models. To group the different cryptocurrencies we use the k means clustering algorithm. Finally we will visualize our data with graphs and tables using plotly and hvplot.
